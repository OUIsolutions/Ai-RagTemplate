- C compiler (gcc, clang)

How to build for testing:
```bash
darwin run_blueprint build/ --mode folder local_linux_build
```

How to build for production:
```bash
darwin run_blueprint build/ --mode folder amalgamation_build alpine_static_build windowsi32_build windowsi64_build rpm_static_build debian_static_build
